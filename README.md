# dTree
*A library for visualizing data trees with multiple parents built on top of D3.*

## Requirements
To use the library the follow dependencies must be loaded:
 - [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) v3.
 - [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) v3.10

```

The options object has the following default values:
```
{
  target: '#graph',
  width: 600,
  height: 600,
  margin: {
    top: 10,
    right: 10,
    bottom: 10,
    left: 10
  },
  textOffset: {
    x: -3,
    y: 3
  }
}
```

## Development
